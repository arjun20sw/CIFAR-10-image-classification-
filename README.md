# CIFAR-10 Image Classification

This project implements an image classification model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using Machine Learning techniques.

## 📂 Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.

- Classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck
- Training images: 50,000
- Test images: 10,000

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Build and train a machine learning model to classify CIFAR-10 images.
- Evaluate the performance of the model on test data.
- Visualize training accuracy and loss.
- Analyze predictions using confusion matrix and classification report.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- TensorFlow / PyTorch / Scikit-learn (choose based on your implementation)
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## 📊 Model Summary

- Preprocessing: Normalization, One-hot encoding
- Model: (Mention if it's CNN, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
